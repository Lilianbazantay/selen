<pre id="Angela">
Born in a poor family, Angela had 5 sisters and 6 brothers. She was born in the region of -----, in an ever-expanding city, before the Evil take down a part of the world.
At her 8, she began to work for her family, working in the fields or making clothes with her older sisters. She was hardworking for her family and was ready to work even more everyday. She was helping other farmers, to help them survive too.
She was a cute, young, and what we can call a naive girl. Around her 13, her dad died from unknow circumstances. The brothers had to do the dad work to survive, and they all died, one by one, in less than 6 months.
Her mother died a month after all of this, while crying her lost childs. Angela was the youngest sister. She was always radiant and smiling. She understood everything that happened and worked even more hard, cleaning people house, working in other people field, skipping sleep to hunt animals.
She learned to fight, to use weapons, to use words when needed. Then, when she get 15, she get a job in a high society place. Working as a maid, she one day heard the conversation between two of the buisnessman, while she was cleaning around.

- "These people are annoying. The market is getting down because the harvest is early. Get rid of these people RIGHT NOW or you will go down with them"
- "But sir, we already killed nearly 30 last year, people will start to realise what we are doing if we continue like this"
- "I don't mind, it's your problem. You let the poor get child and now you will pay the consequences"
- "Alright sir. We already get rid of most of the hardworking man in the south of the city, farm are starting to collapse and women are starting to work for us. It's getting well. May we continue this later, so as not to arouse suspicion"

Everything was getting mixed up in Angela's head.
Was it these men who killed her family? Because of these people? Wealthy people who would kill the poor to make themselves even richer? Could it be because of them that she wasted her youth working for nothing except a meal at the end of the day?
"This world is disgusting. These people deserve nothing. They're doomed to hell. AND I'M GOING TO SHOW THEM."
Angela get back to the kitchen. She grab a butcher knife, and a cup of coffee. She get back to the room where the buisnessmans are.
- "I never ordered a coffee ?"; say the first buisnessman.
Angela spills the hot coffee on his face.
- "ARE YOU STUPID? YOU WILL GET FIRED FOR THAT, TRUST ME!"
She grabbed the knife she had hidden under her skirt, and without a moment's hesitation, sliced off the buisnessman's hand.
- "Ah..."; He felled on the ground, screaming. Angela finished him off with a blow to the throat.
The second buisnessman, staring in terror, could not get a word out of his mouth. He picked up his wallet and threw some notes at Angela.
Angela stooped down, picked up the note and tore it up.
He then begged her : "Please! I've done nothing wrong! I have a wife and children".
Angela smiled, then replied :
"Those poor peasants too".
The man realised his mistake. He barely had time to regret it before everything around him went black.
Angela took the wallet.

<pre id="Lise">
A young girl around 9 years old was playing hide-and-seek with her friend, and she ends up hiding in a closet.
A few minutes later, her father accompanied by his friend entered the room and started scheming about something horrible. She says to herself that adults' talk can only be understood by adult. But she can't ignore the murder that would soon follow. The scene petrifies her, and the slaughter is etched in her mind forever.

<pre id="Angela">
A bit after, she went back to her sisters.
- "Sis! Look at this! I got this for you!"; shouted angela, with joy in her voice.
- "Where did you get this? I hope you didn't get into any trouble?"; replied the older sister.
- "I found it on the ground! Take everything, and get out of this city!"; answered Angela.
- "Place it back! We already have enough problems, it's not so you can bring us more! Go back to work, you're supposed to be on duty at this time of day!"
- "I don't think the people I work for are here any more..."; muttered Angela.
- "Stop your nonsense. Hurry up!"
Angela turned her back and walked out the door without looking back.
- "You should be gentler with her, she's still young and innocent."; said another sister.

Angela headed back to the castle where she work. On the way, she decided it was time for a change. She no longer wanted to help these people who only thought of themselves. She no longer wanted to have a family who only saw her as a source of money.
She wants to leave. That evening, she paid a man to guide her to <a href="places.html#Jarima">Jarima</a>, a market town known for its high crime rate. She doesn't know what she wants, but what she does know is that she's prepared to do anything to get rid of these people.

Angela was 19 now. She had never recovered from these events. What had become of her sisters? Were they killed because of her? Did they starve to death for lack of money? Maybe they got away with it?

<pre id="Angela-Yuri">
One day, she bumped into a young girl in the street.
She was dressed in an outfit never seen before, a very pale shade of skin, with beautiful black hair. Angela politely apologised and continued to walk, while the girl stopped.

- "You like to kill... no... you're after revenge, aren't you?"
Angela turned round.
- "I don't think I quite understand... Are you lost, young lady?"
- "Who hurt you so much? You have a beautiful heart and yet such an empty gaze"
It was as if this girl was reading his mind. Angela didn't know how to react
"Have you killed yet?" the girl asked.
- "What are you talking about?" replied Angela, looking embarrassed.
The girl started to laugh
- "Hahahah! You are adorable. Tell me, why do you hide it? It's obvious to someone like me. You know, I can give you what you're looking for. You want revenge? I can give it to you. You want peace? I can bring it."
Angela's worried face suddenly changed into a serious one.
- "Who are you?"
- "Yuri, the one who's going to solve this world's problems. By any means."
Angela's heart began to pound. She'd heard the name before in rumours. The most notorious group of criminals since the Expansion of Evil, called the "3vils 4ngels", would be led by a young girl in an eccentric outfit. This group would be known for its armed attacks on certain military bases charged with protecting the surrounding area, and on numerous aristocrats.
Yuri continued:
"I like the way you look at me. I love this desire to kill all around you. How about joining me?"
Angela lowered her eyes, and didn't answer.
"I've got a question for you. What do you think of the world we live in?"
Angela looked up.
- "It's a bad one."
- "Are you sure you wouldn't like to make it disappear by my side?"
Everything seemed so strange. Time was eternal. It was as if no one noticed this strange girl. Her sadistic smile was both terrifying and bewitching.
- "Why would I do that?"
- "You'll never make it on your own. And you know it. I can teach you anything you want to know about this world. I can help you."
Angela knew that. She couldn't go it alone. This girl was right. Deep down, what Angela really wanted was a family who, like her, would fight against what people called "society".
- "I accept." replied Angela, in a serious tone.
Yuri smiled sadistically, then returned to a serious expression
- "I'm being followed. Prove your abilities by eliminating our opponents. Together, we'll go far."
- "With pleasure." replied Angela.
- "One last thing. From today, your code name will be 堕天使 (datenshi)"
- "What does that mean?"
- "Where I come from, it means 'Fallen Angel'."
Angela smiles. She grabbed the knife she always keeps with her, and went down an alley accompanied by Yuri. Blood flowed that night.
